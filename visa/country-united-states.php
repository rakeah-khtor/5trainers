                <h3>1. Study at some of the world’s top schools</h3>
                <p>view of iron gates in a stone wall on a college campus
                    You may find yourself at a prestigious institution!

                    When you look at the global rankings for top universities, many of them are American. And while
                    being able to claim a spot at one of those elite institutions might add to the obvious benefits of
                    studying in the USA for international students, there are also numerous top-tier programs that don’t
                    count among the Ivy League.

                    For example, if you’re interested in robotics, you might pursue a degree at MIT or Cooper Union—but
                    you could also find yourself at the Colorado School of Mines. There is no shortage of excellent
                    schools and programs to choose from.

                <h3>2. Experience a rich diversity of food and culture</h3>
                <p>American cultural history is largely influenced by both indigenous and immigrant cultures. College
                    towns tend to have a reputation for being places where that diversity is evident.

                    When you study abroad in the US, you can listen to music, go to museums, and enjoy coffee-house and
                    pub conversations that will not only enhance your social life, but they will also enhance your
                    learning opportunities.

                    Many college and university communities become almost like extensions of the campus, offering plenty
                    of places to continue learning while out with your friends.

                <h3>3. Build your network and make friends with people from around the world</h3>
                <p>If you decide that studying abroad in America is the right choice for you, there will be
                    opportunities for you to build your network and make friends with people from around the world.

                    Not only is the US a destination for people everywhere, college campuses and off-campus housing are
                    filled with students from across the country and from every area of the globe.

                    You will be in good company when you enroll in an American institution, and you’ll find that the
                    relationships you build are among the many benefits of studying in the USA for international
                    students everywhere.

                    Your program could afford you unique opportunities.

                    It could be that your home country is rich with resources and opportunities to access the best
                    technology, and that personal freedoms and comforts are nothing new to you. If that’s the case, then
                    that is excellent news—and the transition to American life will be relatively seamless.

                    But if you’re from a developing country, studying abroad in America could help you to connect with
                    the kinds of resources that make learning in the US an incredibly attractive opportunity to learn,
                    grow, and gain access to tools that will set your learning path apart from what you could gain at
                    home.

                <h3>5. Enjoy a wide range of climates</h3>
                <p>The US has a variety of geographies and climates. If you prefer snowy surroundings, warmth
                    year-round, access to lakes, oceans, or rivers—then the US holds the right environment for studying
                    abroad in America.

                    If four-seasons are what you crave, you’ll find plenty of places with crisp falls, cold winters,
                    balmy springs, and hot summers; and if you want to keep your humidity high year-round, there are
                    plenty of coastal towns with colleges that would be perfect for you.

                    Whatever weather you might want for your time abroad, you’ll be able to find it in the US.

                <h3>6. Travel easily across state borders </h3>
                <p>Even though these States are United, you can find a wide variety of regional and state variety from
                    one location to the next. And the best part is that you can travel freely from state to state
                    without any kind of specific permit or extra paperwork.

                    One of the benefits of studying in the USA for international students is definitely the opportunity
                    to see so much of the country with very little effort. Other than small fees and paying tolls for
                    turnpike travel, you can readily go from one state’s major city to another state’s countryside with
                    little more than a GPS and gas money.

                    Studying in the U.S. will leave you more prepared for your future career.

                    International experience is always going to be something that sets your resume or CV apart from
                    someone else with comparable educational experience. When you get out of your comfort zone and
                    travel abroad for school, you demonstrate courage, curiosity, flexibility, and an innovative spirit.

                    These are the skills of the new economy and the time you spend studying abroad in the US will show
                    any potential employer that you are willing to expand your horizons through thoughtful planning and
                    hard work.

                <h3>8. Take advantage of a flexible course of study</h3>
                <p>Most American universities will feature a wide variety of electives and complementary programs,
                    sometimes with other colleges and universities within their own region or consortium. This provides
                    those studying abroad in America with a wide range of possible opportunities to pursue coursework
                    beyond your major.

                    For example, if you’re interested in studying architecture in the United States, you could find
                    yourself in Silicon Valley, adding an innovation skill-building program to your resume over winter
                    break. The possibilities are truly endless!

                <p>person studying on an outdoor bench
                    If you want to gain English fluency, studying abroad in America is a great idea.

                    One of the obvious benefits of studying in the USA for international students is the opportunity to
                    perfect your English language skills. As with any kind of immersion program, the demands of
                    developing your fluency are high, but so is the level of support for learning as you go.

                    Most campuses have English Language Learner resources, which can really help. You will also get
                    great practice in the work you do in your field of study, while socializing with other students, and
                    in the various workshops, conversation circles, and cultural clubs that exist on campus.

                <h3>10. Open the door to future international opportunities</h3>
                <p>Finally, whether it’s the networks you build, the degrees you earn, the roles you hold, or the places
                    you go, when you’re studying abroad in the US, you’re building the pathway to all kinds of future
                    opportunities.

                    After you complete your college program, you might apply for an internship, or find another program
                    to pursue. You might meet your future co-founder in your classroom, or be inspired to stay connected
                    to leaders within your community.

                    Whatever you decide to do next, when you pursue a study abroad opportunity, your options will only
                    grow!
